I want to make 2 lines as followed:
	1. first line should have a green square (similar to the size of a bullet point) and beside that there should be a text "Positive comments"
	2. second line should have a red square (similar to the size of a bullet point) and beside that there should be a text "Negative comments"


generate the html and css code for that. only use the div tag of html.
Use "className" instead of class. and make indentation and line break in css. the indentation in both html and css should be 8 spaces.

Break the following code into 5 separate loops to analyze all the comment without getting "non-resposive" chrome tab
	
	 for (let i = 0; i < comments.length; i++) {
		let current_sentiment = await p(comments[i]);

		const { label } = current_sentiment[0];

		if (label === "POSITIVE") {
			positive_comments_counter++;
		} else if (label === "NEGATIVE") {
			negative_comments_counter++;
		}
	  }

The indentation should be 8 spaces.
don't change the code too much and try to keep thigs as they are now.
After each batch, make a gap of 0.5 seconds using the settime() or whatever is used in js.
Don't make a separate funciton to do that.
