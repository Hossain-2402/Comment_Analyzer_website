I want to make 2 lines as followed:
	1. first line should have a green square (similar to the size of a bullet point) and beside that there should be a text "Positive comments"
	2. second line should have a red square (similar to the size of a bullet point) and beside that there should be a text "Negative comments"


generate the html and css code for that. only use the div tag of html.
Use "className" instead of class. and make indentation and line break in css. the indentation in both html and css should be 8 spaces.
